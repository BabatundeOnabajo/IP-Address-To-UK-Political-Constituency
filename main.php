# Description: This is the main PHP file that you should use once you have configured your server and databases correctly. Note that some places here require you to enter your own credentials.
# Comments will be provided throughout this code to assist you, together with an explanation.

# As with all PHP/MySQL scripts, you first need to use the correct credentials to access the database. On local/development servers, the username is usually "root" and the password is left blank. Please edit this according to your own circumstances.
$servername = "localhost"; #USE YOUR OWN CREDENTIALS HERE.
$username = "root"; #USE YOUR OWN CREDENTIALS HERE.
$password = ""; #USE YOUR OWN CREDENTIALS HERE.

$conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password); #USE YOUR OWN CREDENTIALS HERE.



# We create the session variable $_SESSION['ukPoliticalConstituency'], which stores the visitor's likely constituency, as an array because it is possible in rare instances that more than 
# one constituency is returned. We will use this later to store the user's constituency information in an array.

$_SESSION['ukPoliticalConstituency'] = array(); #This creates the array for the purposes set out above.

# According to IP2Location, whose data underpins one of the databases, if we would like to convert an IP address to an IP number (which is what we want to do), we need to do the following:

# If the IP address 161.132.13.1, then the IP number is 2709785857. 

# IP Number, X = 161 * (256*256*256) + 132 * (256 * 256) + 13 * (256) + 1 = 2709785857

# In general, this is the formula to convert an IP address to an IP number.

# Let us assume the IP address is A.B.C.D.

# IP Number, X = A * (256*256*256) + B * (256 * 256) + C * 256 + D

if(isset($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'])){ #This checks the user's IP address. Note that this is not exhaustive because it might not include proxy servers, but so as to not bloat this code,
  # this has been omitted. Please speak to a programmer if you would like to adopt this.

$ipAddress = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']; #We store the user's IP address from $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] to a variable we call $ipAddress.
